    "Before we begin, here are a few remarks regarding the codebase for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For every experiment, you would define a config dictionary (see the dictionary in `./cfgs/exercise_3/cnn_cifar10.py`). Every config dictionary, will have the configuration for \n",
    "- data (e.g batch size, shuffle, which DataModule to use, splitting)\n",
    "- model (e.g which class module to use and what arguments to pass to it)\n",
    "- training (e.g type of optimizer, lr_scheduler, n_epochs etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataModules are located at  `src/data_loaders/` and they inherit from a base_data_module that handles things such as splitting the data (see `src/data_loaders/base_data_modules.py`). A sample datamodule may inherit from this class (e.g `src/data_loaders/data_modules.py`). The main concern is that datamodule initialization should get everything ready, so that one can simply get the dataloaders for train/held-out sets from it (see `get_loader` and `get_heldout_loader` in BaseDataModule). The data augmentations are also done in a preset fation. One defines the preset in `utils/transform_presets.py` and simply specifies the *preset key* in the config for datamodule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models are defined in `src/models/` (see for instance `src/models/cnn/model.py`). These are typical Pytorch nn.Modules that we had also seen in Assignment 2. They might additionally have extra methods such as `VisualizeFilter` in `model.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traier glues everything together. It creates the model, sets up optimizer, lr_schduler etc. and has the option to `train()` or `evaluate()` a model over the given dataloaders. It also logs everything in `Logs/YOUR_EXP_NAME.log` and saves the checkpoints under the `Saved/YOUR_EXP_NAME/`. Please familirize yourself with the `__init__` and methods of both `trainers/base_trainer.py` and `trainers/cnn_trainer.py` before continuing with the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, for tracking different metrics (top(1/5) (train/val) accuracy or losses), we use a MetricTracker object defined in `src/utils/utils.py`. A single tracker keeps track of multiple metric keys and can `update()` their history by adding new values to a list. In the end, it can be used to return an average of a metric.\n",

    "Our architecture is shown in Fig 1. It has five convolution blocks. Each block is consist of convolution, max pooling, and ReLU operation in that order. We will use 3×3 kernels in all convolutional layers. Set the padding and stride of the convolutional layers so that they maintain the spatial dimensions. Max pooling operations are done with 2×2 kernels, with a stride of 2, thereby halving the spatial resolution each time. Finally, stacking these five blocks leads to a 512 × 1 × 1 feature map. Classification is achieved by a fully connected layer. We will train convolutional neural networks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Implement a class ConvNet to define the model described. The ConvNet takes 32 × 32 color images as inputs and has 5 hidden layers with 128, 512, 512, 512, 512 filters, and produces a 10-class classification.\n",

Hence, there is no reason for our latest training checkpoint (the last checkpoint after the last epoch) to be the best to keep. One simple idea is to save a checkpoint of the best model for the validation set throughout the training. Meanining that as the training proceeds, we keep checking our **validation** accuracy after each epoch (or every N epochs) and save the best model. This can mitigate overfitting, as if the model overfits to training data (and accuracy on validation set drops), we would still have access to the best model checkpoint! Note that you **should not** do this on the test set, as we are not alowed to optimize **anything** (including the checkpoint selection) on the test set.\n",

    "### Question 3: Improve generalization of Convolutional Networks (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in Q2 that the model can start over-fitting to the training set if we continue training for long. To prevent over-fitting, there are two main paradigms we can focus on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is to get more training data. This might be a difficult and expensive process. However, it is generally the most effective way to learn more general models. A cheaper alternative is to perform data augmentation. The second approach is to regularize the model to prevent overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sub-questions, we will experiment with each of these paradigms and measure the effect on the model generalization. We recommend disabling Early Stopping from previous question (simply removing it from config file) so that it does not interrupt your experiments with data augmentations and you maintain full control over number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Data augmentation is the process of creating more training data by applying certain transformations to the training set images. Usually, the underlying assumption is that the label of the image does not change under the applied transformations. This includes geometric transformations like translation, rotation, scaling, flipping, random cropping, and color transformations like greyscale, colorjitter. For every image in the training batch, a random transformation is sampled from the possible ones (e.g., a random number of pixels to translate the image by) and is applied to the image. While designing the data input pipeline, we must choose the hyper-parameters for these transformations (e.g., limits of translation or rotation) based on things we expect to see in the test-set/real world. Your task in this question is to implement the data augmentation for the CIFAR-10 classification task. Many of these transformations are implemented in the `torchvision.transforms` package. Familiarize yourself with the APIs of these transforms, and functions to compose multiple transforms or randomly sample them. Next, implement geometric and color space data augmentations for the CIFAR-10 dataset, by choosing the right functions and order of application. Tune the hyper-parameters of these data augmentations to improve the validation performance. You will need to train the model a bit longer (20-30 epochs) with data augmentation, as the training data is effectively larger now. Discuss which augmentations work well for you in the report. (6 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create as many config dictionaries as you need in `cnn_cifar10.py`. For every augmentation, simply create a new preset under `src/utils/transform_presets.py` and reference its name in your experiment's config dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Dropout is a popular scheme to regularize the model to improve generalization. The dropout layer works by setting the input activations randomly to zero at the output. You can implement Dropout by adding the `torch.nn.Dropout` layer between the conv blocks in your model. The layer has a single hyper-parameter $p$, which is the probability of dropping the input activations. High values of $p$ regularize the model heavily and decrease model capacity, but with low values, the model might overfit. Find the right hyper-parameter for $p$ by training the model for different values of $p$ and comparing training validation and validation accuracies. You can use the same parameter $p$ for all layers. You can also disable the data augmentation from the previous step while running this experiment, to clearly see the benefit of dropout. Show the plot of training and validation accuracies for different values of dropout (0.1 - 0.9) in the report. Create as many config dictionaries as you need in `cnn_cifar10.py`. (4 points)"

    "### Question 4: Use pretrained networks (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "It has become standard practice in computer vision tasks related to images to use a convolutional network pre-trained as the backbone feature extraction network and train new layers on top for the target task. In this question, we will implement such a model. We will use the `VGG_11_bn` network from the `torchvision.models` library as our backbone network. This model has been trained on ImageNet, achieving a top-5 error rate of 10.19%. It consists of 8 convolutional layers followed by adaptive average pooling and fully-connected layers to perform the classification. We will get rid of the average pooling and fully-connected layers from the `VGG_11_bn` model and attach our own fully connected layers to perform the CIFAR-10 classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Instantiate a pretrained version of the `VGG_11_bn` model with ImageNet pre-trained weights. Add two fully connected layers on top, with Batch Norm and ReLU layers in between them, to build the CIFAR-10 10-class classifier. Note that you will need to set the correct mean and variance in the data-loader, to match the mean and variance the data was normalized with when the `VGG_11_bn` was trained. Train only the newly added layers while disabling gradients for the rest of the network. Each parameter in PyTorch has a required grad flag, which can be turned off to disable gradient computation for it. Get familiar with this gradient control mechanism in PyTorch and train the above model. As a reference point, you will see validation accuracies in the range (61-65%) if implemented correctly. (6 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "b) We can see that while the ImageNet features are useful, just learning the new layers does not yield better performance than training our own network from scratch. This is due to the domain-shift between the ImageNet dataset (224x224 resolution images) and the CIFAR-10 dataset (32x32 images). To improve the performance we can fine-tune the whole network on the CIFAR-10 dataset, starting from the ImageNet initialization (set `\"fine_tune\"` to `true` in `vgg_cifar10.py`). To do this, enable gradient computation to the rest of the network, and update all the model parameters. Additionally train a baseline model where the entire network is trained from scratch, without loading the ImageNet weights (set `\"weights\"` to `None` in `vgg_cifar10.py`). Compare the two models' training curves, validation, and testing performance in the report. (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Pytorch 1, the `weights` argument will not work. In that case, you need to change the `weights` argument to `pretrained=True` or `False`. Feel free to post on Forum if you have any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both questions, feel free to modify the data augmentation by defining a new preset and referring to it in the config file. However, make sure that in your experiments you always change only one thing at a time (i.e use the same augmentation for both method A and method B if you're comparing them with each other!)"
