    "In this exercise, we get to have a first hands-on experience with neural network training. Many frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow, Caffe) allow easy usage of deep neural networks without precise knowledge of the inner workings of backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms. While these are very useful tools, it is important to get a good understanding of how to implement basic network training from scratch before using these libraries to speed up the process. For this purpose, we will implement a simple two-layer neural network and its training algorithm based on back-propagation using only basic matrix operations in questions 1 to 3. In question 4, we will use a popular deep learning library, PyTorch, to do the same and understand the advantages offered by using such tools.\n",

    "First, we decided to remove the application of weights_init(m) function. The reason for this decision was that it made the training process significantly unstable and the results were irreproducable specifically for deeper networks. This kind of initialization caused the model to initiate probably in flat areas of loss surface and model did not improve during the training process. Pytorch's weight initialization scheme works perfectly and the model snd doesn't get stuck in the initialization point.\n",

    "The results of our experiments are presented in the table below. The most evident trend in the results is that by increasing the depth of the network both train and validation accuracy increase. We bagan with one hidden layer of 50 neurons achieving 48.30% validation accuracy and increased the performance to 56.30% using deeper networks. However, one drawback of this approach is that by increasing the model's capacity, we increase the chance of overfit. The gap between train and test accuracy began with 5.71% for the network with one hidden layer and increased to 11.13% for a network with 5 hidden layers. \n",

    "We also experimented with different activation functions. We kept the structure (number of hidden layers and number of neurons per layer) constant for the best performing deep network and used 2 other activation functions than ReLU (LeakyRELU, GELU). Both activation functions improved ReLU's baseline and GELU activation function achieved the highest validation accuracy within the given structure and we chose this model for further testing. The final test result on 1000 test images is 55.90%\n",
